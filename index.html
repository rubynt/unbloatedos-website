		<h2>What is bloat?</h2>
		<p id="bloat"><i>
&emsp;Software bloat is a process whereby successive versions of a 
computer program become perceptibly slower, use more memory, disk space or 
processing power, or have higher hardware requirements than the previous 
versionâ€” while making only dubious user-perceptible improvements or suffering
from feature creep. The term is not applied consistently; it is often used as 
a pejorative by end users (bloatware) to describe undesired user interface 
changes even if those changes had little or no effect on the hardware 
requirements. In long-lived software, perceived bloat can occur from the 
software servicing a large, diverse marketplace with many differing 
requirements. Most end users will feel they only need some limited subset of 
the available functions, and will regard the others as unnecessary bloat, 
even if end users with different requirements require those functions.</i><p>
